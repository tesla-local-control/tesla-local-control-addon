# Home Assistant Add-on: Tesla Local Commands

Send commands via MQTT to a Tesla car using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)


This Addon is a package of [tesla_ble_mqtt_core]https://github.com/tesla-local-control/tesla_ble_mqtt_core
It runs the official Tesla Vehicle SDK commands via BLE to activate various entities in your Tesla.
This is to bypass the current Fleet API rate limitation as it does not rely on the API.

See tab **Documentation** for more details

> [!WARNING]
> Using onboard bluetooth on Raspberry Pi has proven is sensitive to overheating, especially if your car is far from the device.
> You can try setting up the integration iBeacons and check that the signal strength is above -80 dBm.
> You can also a small fan to cool down the RPi Wifi/Bluetooth chipset. There are ready made cases with this for ~10-15â‚¬/$

> How to know you are affected?
> - Commands are not getting to the car, you see a lot of
