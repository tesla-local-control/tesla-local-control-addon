# Home Assistant Add-on: Tesla Local Commands

## Prerequisites

You must already have a working MQTT broker. If you want the entities to be auto-discovered by Home Assistant (HA), then the HA MQTT Integration must already be set up and working. See: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/
The advantage of the MQTT setup is that it can run on a device separate to your HA server, e.g. Raspberry Pi located close to where you park your car 

# Installation and setup

If you have already created a key pair that you want to reuse, place the private key in `/share/tesla_ble_mqtt`

## 1.1 HA Add-on: install below and configure

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/tesla-local-control/tesla-local-control-addon)


You will need to provide:
- vin_list : VIN single or multiple separated by either of | , or space; Required
- ble_mac_list : BLE MAC Addr list single or multiple separated by a | (pipe); Optional for car presence detection
- presence_detection_loop_delay: The delay between each time the process checks for the presence of your car(s)
- presence_detection_ttl : TTL in seconds when car is considered gone after last received BLE advertisement; 0 to disable detection
- mqtt_server : Hostname or IP of your MQTT server; Default 127.0.0.1
- mqtt_port : MQTT service port; Default 1883
- mqtt_useranme : MQTT Username; Default anonymous
- mqtt_password : MQTT Password
- ble_cmd_retry_delay : Delay to retry sending a command to the car over BLE; Default 5
- Start the add-on, check the logs for anything suspecious.

ATTENTION: If you have multiple cars and require presence detection, the cars' position in vin_list vin{n} must match the position in the ble_mac_list. In other words, the BLE MAC Addr in the 2nd position must match the same car's VIN in the 2nd position of the tesla_vin_list.

## 1.2 For the standalone Docker version please see https://github.com/tesla-local-control/tesla_ble_mqtt_docker

## 2.0 Check in HA for new devices named Tesla_BLE_MQTT_VIN ???

- A new device called Tesla_BLE_MQTT should have automatically appeared. Click it to view the the associated entities.
- If this is the first time you have run the container, press the 'Generate Keys' button in HA (Settings -> Devices & Services -> Devices (tab) -> Tesla_BLE_MQTT). This will generate the public and private keys as per Shanker's blog
- **Wake up your car using the Tesla App**. Then press the 'Deploy Key' button. This will deploy the public key to the car. You will then need to access your car and use a Key Card to accept the public key into the car (see the blog for screenshots)
  - If the command succeed to initiate the pairing with the car, the following will show in the add-on logs: `Sent add-key request to [YOUR_CAR_VIN]. Confirm by tapping NFC card on center console.` Go in your car and tap your NFC card on the center console and on the car's screen `Phone Key pairing request`, confirm your accept the pairing
  - If the command failed, the following error will show up: `Error: failed to find BLE beacon for [YOUR_CAR_VIN]. (xxx): can’t scan: context deadline exceeded`. You car might just be too far from your Bluetooth adapter. The command will be tried in case bluetooth is weak or unavailable...
- Then you are ready. Press the other button entities to send various commands... You can use the relevant service calls in HA automations if you wish
